In principle it is based on @yorikvanhavre Texture Objects macro

https://wiki.freecad.org/Macro_Texture_Objects

## How to use
- Select the face or faces where you want to apply the cosmetic threads
- Run the macro CosmeticThreads.FCMacro
- A group called "CosmeticThreads" will be created, where all the applied textures are grouped.
